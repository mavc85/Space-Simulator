#Space Simulator

An interactive space physics simulator. 

Choose from a series of ready-to-go scenes, or create your own in the command line. Supports custom size, mass, color, names, positions, and velocities. When you are ready to go, play out your simulation with physically accurate gravity and collisions. Supports controlling the speed of the simulation and the tilt angle of the orbital plane. Click on bodies to get live statistics on a body's velocity, position, name, etc. Finally, can pause, play, and restart the scene. Set the scene and watch Newtonian accurate gravitational physics unfold!
