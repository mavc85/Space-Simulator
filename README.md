#Space Simulator

My final project for CS3110. An interactive space body physics simulator. 

Choose from a series of ready-to-go scenes of celestial bodies, or create your own in the command line. Then you can customize the size, mass, color, names, positions, and velocities of any body. When you are ready to go, play out your simulation with physically accurate gravity and collisions. Supports controlling the speed of the simulation and the tilt angle of the orbital plane. Click on bodies to get live statistics on a body's velocity, position, name, etc. Finally, can pause, play, and restart the scene. Set the scene and watch Newtonian accurate gravitational physics unfold!
